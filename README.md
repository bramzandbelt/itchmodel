# itchmodel - Intertemporal choice model

## 1. Overview
Itchmodel is a computational model that can be used to test time framing effects in intertemporal choice (i.e. the defer/speedup and date/delay effects). The model is based on two previous models by [Scholten & Read](https://doi.org/10.1037/a0031171) and [Dai & Busemeyer](https://doi.org/10.1037/a0035976).
